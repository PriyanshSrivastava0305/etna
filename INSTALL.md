# Installation Guide for ETNA

## AUR:

We have packaged `etna-git` for the AUR. For now, `etna-bin` is not available, but it may be packaged by the community in the future.

## Building:

ETNA installs to `/usr/local/bin/` by default. You can change this behavior by editing the [Makefile](../Makefile) variable, `DESTDIR`, which acts as a prefix for all installed files. Alternatively, specify it in the make command line. For example, to install everything in a specific directory, run:



## Dependencies:

**Runtime:**
-   Python 3
-   PyTorch
-   Pandas
-   Numpy

**Compile time:**
-   git
-   make

## Compiling:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/etsi-ai/etna.git
    cd etna
    ```

2. Setup dependencies and environment:
    ```
    make setup
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```
    make clean
    make
    ```

4. Install the project:
    ```
    sudo make install
    ```

## Running:

Once installed, you can start using the ETNA model. Hereâ€™s a basic usage example:

```python
import etsi.etna as etna

model = etna.Model("diabetes.csv", target="Outcome")
model.train()
model.evaluate()
